# CRYPTOFIELDS KIDS

CRYPTOFIELDS KIDS is a metaverse-based life simulation artwork where users temporarily care for virtual children who grow, learn, and eventually leave.

This project emphasizes:
- ordinary childhood
- modeling behavior instead of instruction
- finite relationships
- ethical AI interaction
- quiet moments over gamification

## Platforms
- Unity 2022 LTS
- Spatial.io
- Node.js backend
- Web frontend (Next.js)

## Status
Early build / MVP

## Ethics
This project does not simulate parenting, therapy, or emotional dependency.
All children are AI simulations with strict age-based and content safeguards.
Each relationship is finite and concludes with a permanent goodbye.

## Structure
- `/unity` – Spatial-ready Unity project
- `/backend` – AI + memory services
- `/website` – cryptofieldskids.com frontend
- `/docs` – design, ethics, exhibition text
